<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I want to build up my prospects so that in 10 years I can provide security for myself on a more independent basis.</p>
	
<ol><p><li>Financial security.</p>
<p>I want to be a freelancer. I will post websites for people, edit work and post analyses, not for mere code. Rather anyone who wants material online will be able to contract with me--to have their message placed on the Internet, their message properly pitched and their data evaluated and sorted out.</p></li>
	
<p><li>Companionate security.</p>

<p>I want to be connected into a network--people with common interests and common subjects to talk with, to be friends or perhaps even more. I want my network to provide business contacts, recreational opportunities, romance and supporters for my next moves at any given time.</p></li>
		
<p><li>Romantic security.</p>

<p>I want a girlfriend who is not weirded out by me. I want a girlfriend who is interested in many of the things I am interested in. I want a girlfriend who can be integrated into my network of friends and who can integrate me into her network of friends.</p></li>
				
</ol>
	
<h2>My Cause--Standing for the Truth</h2>

<p>I think the way the world is, is not the way it should be. I would like to refine my expressive abilities over the course of the next 10 years so I can podcast, write or perhaps even YouTube on what&#39;s wrong. I want to express insight into what&#39;s missing and to express to the best of my analytical abilities, what the actual truth is.</p>
